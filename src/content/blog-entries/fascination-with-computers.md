I became fascinated by computers at a young age. Like many kids, I started by playing
video games. Two video games in particular, Starcraft and Warcraft, had the greatest 
effect on me. Both are real-time strategy games that allowed people to create their 
own custom maps that were basically mini games. I spent countless hours playing such mini games online without even playing the main game.

It was through playing these games that I learned a lot about computers and what can be done with them.
First of all, being able to create your own custom map inside a game was mind opening. As a kid, my parents weren't strapped in money so I didn't get a new video game every month.
I remember playing the same games over and over again out of boredom. Once I started playing Starcraft and Warcraft, I got access to an infinite amount of custom maps that other people would share.

Another thing about Starcraft and Warcraft was that you could play online with other people. This was also really cool to me then because after playing the same games over and over 
the NPCs became predictable. Being able to play with other people made games way funner and also more challenging. 

Playing with others also showed me the power of online communities. As a kid, I obviously didn't know a lot of things. Whenever I got stuck or confused during a game I would ask
questions in game chat and people were very responsive. From this I was able to learn about websites to download custom maps, game hacking programs, and general things.

All of this allowed me start seeing video games and computer programs in general as something malleable. You could add onto a program, change what a program was initally meant to do, and even hack a program. And through the internet you are able to share and download an infinite amount of programs.
